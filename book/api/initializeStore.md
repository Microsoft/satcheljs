# `initializeStore`

Replaces the value of the root store with the given value.
(See the [`rootStore`](rootStore.md) entry to understand what the root store is.)
This is useful if, for example, you wanted to restore the root store from some serialized snapshot.


## Usage

**`initializeStore(value)`**

* `value` is the value with which to replace the root store.
