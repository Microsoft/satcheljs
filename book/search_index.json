is a dataflow framework based on the Flux architecture.  It is characterized by exposing an observable state that makes view updates painless and efficient.InfluencesSatchel is an attempt to synthesize the best of several dataflow patterns typically used to drive a React-based UI.  In particular:Flux is not a library itself, but is a dataflow pattern conceived for use with React.  In Flux, dataflow is unidirectional, and the only way to modify state is by dispatching actions through a central dispatcher.\n\nRedux is an implementation of Flux that consolidates stores into a single state tree and attempts to simplify state changes by making all mutations via pure functions called reducers.  Ultimately, however, we found reducers and immutable state cumbersome to deal with, particularly in a large, interconnected app.\n\nMobX provides a seamless way to make state observable, and allows React to listen to state changes and rerender in a very performant way.  Satchel uses MobX under the covers to allow React components to observe the data they depend on.\n\nAdvantagesThere are a number of advantages to using Satchel to maintain your application state:Satchel enables a very performant UI, only rerendering the minimal amount necessary.  MobX makes UI updates very efficient by automatically detecting specifically what components need to rerender for a given state change.\n\nSatchel's datastore allows for isomorphic JavaScript by making it feasible to render on the server and then serialize and pass the application state down to the client.\n\nSatchel supports middleware that can act on each action that is dispatched.  (For example, for tracing or performance instrumentation.)\n\nSatchel is type-safe out of the box, without any extra effort on the consumer's part.\n\nInstallationInstall via NPM:npm install satcheljs --saveIn order to use Satchel with React, you'll also need MobX and the MobX React bindings:npm install mobx --savenpm install mobx-react --saveUsageThe following examples assume you're developing in Typescript.Create a store with some initial stateimport { createStore } from 'satcheljs';\n\nlet getStore = createStore(\n    'todoStore',\n    { todos: [] }\n);\nCreate a component that consumes your stateNotice the @observer decorator on the component—this is what tells MobX to rerender the component whenever the data it relies on changes.import { observer } from 'mobx-react';\n\n@observer\nclass TodoListComponent extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n                getStore().todos.map(todo => {todo.text})\n            \n        );\n    }\n}\nImplement an action creatorNote that, as a convenience, Satchel action creators created with the action API both create and dispatch the action.\nThis is typically how you want to use action creators.\nIf you want to create and dispatch the actions separately you can use the actionCreator and dispatch APIs.import { action } from 'satcheljs';\n\nlet addTodo = action(\n    'ADD_TODO',\n    (text: string) => ({ text: text })\n);\n\n// This creates and dispatches an ADD_TODO action\naddTodo('Take out trash');\nImplement a mutatorYou specify what action a mutator subscribes to by providing the corresponding action creator.\nIf you're using TypeScript, the type of actionMessage is automatically inferred.import { mutator } from 'satcheljs';\n\nmutator(addTodo, (actionMessage) => {\n    getStore().todos.push({\n        id: Math.random(),\n        text: actionMessage.text\n    });\n};\nOrchestratorsOrchestrators are like mutators—they subscribe to actions—but they serve a different purpose.\nWhile mutators modify the store, orchestrators are responsible for side effects.\nSide effects might include making a server call or even dispatching further actions.The following example shows how an orchestrator can persist a value to a server before updating the store.import { action, orchestrator } from 'satcheljs';\n\nlet requestAddTodo = action(\n    'REQUEST_ADD_TODO',\n    (text: string) => ({ text: text })\n);\n\norchestrator(requestAddTodo, async (actionMessage) => {\n    await addTodoOnServer(actionMessage.text);\n    addTodo(actionMessage.text);\n};\nmutatorActionIn many cases a given action only needs to be handled by one mutator.\nSatchel provides this utility API which encapsulates action creation, dispatch, and handling in one simple function call.The addTodo mutator above could be implemented as follows:let addTodo = mutatorAction(\n    'ADD_TODO',\n    function addTodo(text: string) {\n        getStore().todos.push({\n            id: Math.random(),\n            text: actionMessage.text\n        });\n    });\nThis is a succinct and easy way to write mutators, but it comes with a restriction:\nthe action creator is not exposed, so no other mutators or orchestrators can subscribe to it.\nIf an action needs multiple handlers then it must use the full pattern with action creators and handlers implemented separately.License -

pattern and the reasoning behind it, you can see Facebook's overview.\nSatchel's version of Flux is a little bit different, but it's still focused on making a large application performant and easy to comprehend, develop, and test.Unidirectional Data FlowOne of the key tenants of Flux is that data only flows in one direction.\nSatchel's data flow looks like this:Application state lives in the store.\nWhen data in the store is changed, the view is rerendered to reflect it.\nThe view creates and dispatches actions.\nMutators subscribe to actions and modify the store in response to them.You'll notice there is another entity that can respond to actions: orchestrators.\nOrchestrators are Satchel's mechanism for dealing with side effects.\nFor instance, an orchestrator might make a service call and dispatch more actions once it returns.Let's look at each of these entities in more detail.StoreThe Satchel store contains the entirety of the application state.\nThe store is just data; unlike some implementations of Flux it doesn't contain business logic.\nThe app state can be segmented into multiple stores (from multiple calls to createStore), but internally they are rooted into a single state object.The root store (and therefore the entire store underneath it) is a MobX observable—this is what allows views to update automatically when the store changes.\nFor the most part you can interact with the store just like any other javascript object, but it is worth understanding how MobX works in order to take advantage of all it has to offer (and to be aware of some pitfalls).It is recommended that the state be a strict tree of simple JavaScript types (objects, arrays, maps, and primitives).\nThis makes it easy to serialize and restore the store, which is necessary for an isomorphic web app and makes possible other dev tooling.ViewsThe view is the UI layer of an application.\nWhile Satchel could work with any view technology, it was built with React in mind.\nThe view layer consists of React components tagged with MobX's @observer decorator.\nBy making a component an observer it will automatically detect changes in the data it depends on and update itself.In a Satchel app components are only responsible for rendering the UI.\nThey should not contain any state (that belongs in the store) and they should not contain business logic (that belongs in mutators and orchestrators).\nMost or all views should be able to be written as stateless functional components.\nGiven the state of the store and the props provided to it, a component should always render the same way.Action CreatorsAction creators construct action messages to be dispatched.\nTypically actions are dispatched in response to some user-initiated event in the UI, but they may also be executed by external entities such as server notifications or timer callbacks.In Satchel, action creators are simple object factories—they should contain no side effects or business logic.\nThey are also consumed by mutators and orchestrators in order to subscribe to the associated action.\n(When writing an application in TypeScript, this allows action messages to be strongly-typed end-to-end.)DispatcherThe dispatcher is effectively just an event aggregator.\nHandlers (mutators and orchestrators) get subscribed to the dispatcher and are called back when the appropriate actions are dispatched.\nThe dispatcher also provides middleware an opportunity to process each dispatched action.The entire dispatch process is wrapped in a MobX transaction which means any UI updates are deferred until all state changes are complete.MutatorsMutators are solely responsible for modifying the store.\n(Typically they reside alongside the store that they apply to.)\nA mutator should have relatively little logic, just what is necessary to update the store based on a dispatched action.\nMutators should not dispatch other actions or have any other side effects.\nIt is possible for multiple mutators to subscribe to the same action—in fact, this is advisable when an action needs to affect disparate parts of the application.OrchestratorsOrchestrators are responsible for dealing with side effects and any other coordination the app may require.\nSide effects might include service calls, setting timers, dealing with browser local storage, etc.\nOrchestrators cannot modify the store directly, but they can dispatch further actions which, indirectly, will cause the store to get modified.In a large app with many stores, orchestrators provide a way to coordinate between the different stores.\nFor example, in response to an action an orchestrator might dispatch a series of additional actions in a specific order, or it might read data from one store and conditionally dispatch actions to affect another store."},"middleware.html":{"url":"middleware.html","title":"Middleware","keywords":"","body":"MiddlewareMiddleware allows you to hook into the dispatch pipeline in
